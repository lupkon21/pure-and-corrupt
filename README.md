# Pure and Corrupt

Explore a world consumed by sin and engulfed in darkness in this 2D dungeon crawler Java game. As a chosen Paladin of the Highest Church, you are tasked with venturing into the heart of Hell itself to bring an end to the overwhelming corruption that has overtaken the land.

## Game lore

Hell is real. And so is Heaven, but people seem like they've forgotten that. The world was taken over by sin. That fueled the forces of Hell to the point where they became much stronger than Heaven and humans ever could imagine. Hell's corruption became so powerful, that the very ground beneath places important to the Church trembled until it broke and sank underground, closer to Hell itself.

Demons, Chaos spawn, Corrupted folk, all invaded the lands of humans and spread fear and destruction. Humans fled right back to what they abandoned. The Highest Church, worshiping the merciful Heaven. Church was the only thing standing between them and total destruction. The Church and their soldiers. Paladins. Such as you. The best of the best. The most pure and uncorrupted of them all. And the Church chose you specifically to go down where it all started. Through the sunken ground, right to the center of Hell and end it all for good. What they forgot to tell you are the bodies of your comrades that have fallen on the very same mission.

## Game items

- **Life crystal** - When inserted to the pummel of the purest weapon, it drains the life force of the foes that fall under the might of your pure weapon.
- **Mighty tooth** - The moment it touches you, it becomes a part of your armor, of your weapon and of you, thus making you more dangerous and more lethal.
- **Thorn parry** - Your shield is grown through with thorny vines. You feel the shield strengthen and new blood coarsing through your veins.
- **Corrupted boots** - A pair of very fancy plated shoes. They are covered in many toes. They make you feel faster... and grossed out. They won't come off.
- **Flesh Cross** - A vile artifact. Fills you with foreign blood and seals all of your wounds with the flesh of unknown origin.
